# Access to the [`EMBL-EBI Cloud Portal`](https://portal.tsi.ebi.ac.uk)

The EMBL-EBI Cloud Portal is offered as a service to ELIXIR and other communities.  
Users will need a freely available [ELIXIR identity](https://www.elixir-europe.org/services/compute/aai) to access the portal.  
Obtain your ELIXIR identity [here](https://www.elixir-europe.org/register). The you can [login](https://portal.tsi.ebi.ac.uk/welcome/login).


# Set up the cloud [`Profile`](https://portal.tsi.ebi.ac.uk/profile)

From the global menu click [`Profile`](https://portal.tsi.ebi.ac.uk/profile).  

A minimal Profile set up include this steps:

- Create a new entry in the `Profile - Cloud Credentials` section.
- Create a new entry in the `Profile - Deployment Parameters` section.
- Create a new entry in the `Profile - Configurations` section.


## Cloud Credentials

Each cloud provider requires a set of **cloud credentials**.  
**Personal credentials** can be set up following the instructions for the specific cloud provider.  
It also possible to use **shared credentials**, in this case the values will not be visible or editable.  
 
### Amazon Web Service (AWS)
Add your `Cloud Credentials` in this form:

Key|Value
|---|---|
`TF_VAR_access_key`|`your_access-key`
`TF_VAR_secret_key`|`your_secret_key`

You can find this information (or create a new one) in you AWS user page under the section:  
`IAM` ---> `USERS`

### Azure
Add your `Cloud Credentials` in this form:

Key|Value
|---|---|
`ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID `|`YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`
`ARM_CLIENT_ID `|`YOUR_CLIENT_ID`
`ARM_CLIENT_SECRET `|`YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET`
`ARM_TENANT_ID `|`YOUR_TENANT_ID`
`ARM_ENVIRONMENT `|`public`

In order to use Terraform with Azure is required to create a `Service Principal` via the Azure portal.  
Terraform documentation provide an extensive explanation that you can find [here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/authenticating_via_service_principal.html#creating-a-service-principal-in-the-azure-portal).

### OpenStack
Add your `Cloud Credentials` in this form:

Key|Value
|---|---|
`OS_AUTH_URL`|`https://extcloud06.ebi.ac.uk:13000/v3`
`OS_USERNAME`|`your_username`
`OS_PASSWORD`|`your_password`
`OS_PROJECT_ID`|`your_project_id `
`OS_PROJECT_NAME`|`EBI-TSI`
`OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME`|`Default`
`OS_INTERFACE`|`public`
`OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION`|`3`

The specific values for your OpenStack provider are contained in the `OpenStack RC file`, which is project-specific and contains the credentials used by OpenStack Compute, Image, and Identity services.

You can download the `OpenStack RC file` file from the OpenStack dashboard as an administrative user or any other user.

1. Log in to the OpenStack dashboard.
2. Choose the `project` for which you want to download the OpenStack RC file
3. Click `Compute` ---> `API Access`.
	(In older version of OpenStack click `Compute` --->`Access & Security`)
4. Click` Download OpenStack RC File` and save the file.

### Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Authenticating with Google Cloud services requires the set up of The [`GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS `](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials#howtheywork)
variable, which can also contains the path of a file to obtain credentials from.

The `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` is available in a JSON file.

This file is downloaded directly from the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).  
To make the process more straightforward, it is documented here:

1. Log into the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) and select a `project`.
2. The API Manager view should be selected, click on `Credentials` on the left, then `Create credentials`, and finally "Service account key".
3. Select `Compute Engine default service account` in the `Service account` drop-down, and select `JSON` as the key type.
4. Clicking `Create` will download your `credentials`.

Once you have your credentials you can add them to `Cloud Credentials` in this form:
    
 Key|Value
|---|---|
|`GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS`| `{ "type":"service_account", "project_id":"", "private_key_id":"", "private_key":"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----", "client_email": "", "client_id":"", "auth_uri":"", "token_uri":"", "auth_provider_x509_cert_url":"", "client_x509_cert_url":""}`


## Deployment parameters

`Deployment parameters` represent a set of inputs specific that are related to the cloud provider and eventually to a specific application.  
In general they provide information about the shared instances that you can have in place in your cloud provider, or just information that you prefer to set up just the first time and avoid to repeat every time you deploy the instance.

The deployment parameters required by an appliance are expressed in the documentation page of the git repository of the same appliance.

For your convenience you can use a single `deployment paramenter` configuration for different appliances:  it will make use only of the share inputs ignoring the ones that are not relevant.  
A deployment parameter can also be used to overwrite any of the variables defined in the `terraform.tfvars` file even when it is not reported as input in the `manifest` file.  

* Note: The current version of the portal is requiring to include the parameters of all the cloud providers, in the deployment configurations. This behaviour will change soon, for the moment please enter a random value for the parameters that are not necessary for your cloud provider.

## Configuration

Configurations represent a way to link a Cloud Credential with a Deployment Parameter and a SSH public key.  
The use of a configuration simplify the deployment of the application, allowing to store and reuse the specified parameters.  
Specify a new configuration is very easy:

 - click on the `+`  button
 - assign assign a name of your choose,
 - choose one of the `Cloud Provider` that you have previously defined,
 - choose one of the `Deployment parameters` that you have previously defined,
 - (optionally) add a public ssh key

## Inputs

`Inputs` parameters represent a set of parameters that are meant to more volatile than the `Deployment paramenters` or just can not be determined in advance.  
They are related to the specific application, and to the cloud provider and eventually.  
They are expressed in the documentation page of the git repository of the same appliance.

You can also avoid to type the inputs and it will use the defaults (but avoid to click with mouse on them, otherwise it will see as a void instead the default).
